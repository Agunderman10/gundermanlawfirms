                            the Columbus Bar Association. Bar associations, such as ours, provide 
                            licenses to lawyers and provide other services to help you devide if you

                            1. $20 Consultation fee - this fee is for your first visit. We believe 
                            this fee is justified because you are coming to us asking for expert
                            information.
                            <br>
                            2. $3000 Retainer fee - this fee is an upfront payment in order for you 
                            to pay for our services in advance for work specified later.
                            <br>
                            3. 40% Contingency fee - this fee is a sum of money that we will receive
                            only AFTER we win your case. If we do not win, you are not required to 
                            pay this fee.

                        <p>
                            If you, as the client, have any complaints about Gunderman Law Firms 
                            that cannot be resolved you may get in contact with your local or state
                            bar association. As our client, you have the right to sue any lawyer 
                            for serious errors that resulted in your injury or loss. This type of 
                            case is known as a legal malpractice case. To handle these types of 
                            situations, some state bar associations have arbitration systems in 
                            which hearings are held to weigh the disagreement and issue opinions.
                            Some disputes deal with the amount of the fee charged for the lawyer's 
                            services. Panels may order the attorney to return some of a client's
                            money if they decide the fee was improper. At Gunderman Law Firms you
                            can have the confidence that your complaints will be heard and dealt
                            with smoothly.

                            Here at Gunderman Law Firms we take the Code of Professional Responsibility
                            very seriously. This means that we will ALWAYS assist in maintaining 
                            the integrity and competence of the law. We will ALWAYS assist in 
                            preventing unauthorized practice of law and we will preserve the
                            confidence and secrets of our clients. Our goal is to ALWAYS exercise
                            independent professional judgement on the behalf of our clients.

                            Breaking our code of professional responsibility can result in several negative outcomes
                            for lawyers and we will not hesitate to compensate our clients who may feel that they have
                            been wronged by one of our associates. Lawyers who violate the standards
                            of our Code of Conduct may be reprimanded, suspended or disbarred. This
                            means that they can no longer practice law. A client who has serious 
                            complaints that cannot be worked out with his or her attorney can report
                            the problem to the local or state bar association. As our client you will have 
                            the right to sue lawyers for serious errors that result in injury or 
                            loss. This is just part of how we strive to protect our clients.
